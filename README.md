# Titanic Kaggle Competition

This is my first attempt in solving a proper Kaggle question. This question is more like a launch pad for me to get started with Kaggle. Anywa it has always been fun to look at data and trying to strike a balance between what it is trying to convey and what is it that you are trying to find!

I implemented 1 model for this task:

1. Random forest model- I have seen decision trees usually perform really good for many Kaggle questions. Accuracy was: 74.16% without any parameter tuning. 

I plan to add graphs and add one-two more models- logistic regression, SVM in future.

You can find this question on [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
